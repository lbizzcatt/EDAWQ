# EDAWQ

This project is an EDA analysis and machine learning problem where we are searching to find red and white wine predictions based off of their correlation maps and using linear regression. This notebook was created with the help of other Kaggle notebooks used for basic coding references and parameters. This notebook was created for a final project.
